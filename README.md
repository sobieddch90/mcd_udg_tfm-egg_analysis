## EEG Data Analysis

Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the best and most recommended non-invasive methods used in neural science, it is responsible for capturing the electrical activity that occurs in the brain of living beings.

The present repository contains a set of Python Notebooks developed for the Master's Final Project in the Data Science Master Degree at the University of Girona. This is a project implemented in collaboration with the eXiT Research Group.

The objective is to implement a set of LED lights in a model that can be manipulated by EEG sensors, during the game in pairs what is desired is to collect the EEG data generated with which the Data Analysis will be developed.

Tools used:
* Python Notebooks (Libraries: MNE, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scipy)
* NeuroSkyLab, NeuroView, ThinkGear
